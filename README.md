#  Dosh Privacy Cryptocurrency


### Open Source Decentralized Blockchain

The advent of Dosh Cryptocurrency is a coherent outcome to the prerequisite for more decentralized untraceable digital cash for everyday use in money transactions. 

  Dosh Cryptocurrency enable Direct, Quick and easy way to exchange values on the bases of equally privileged Peer 2 Peer trading over the community Network, empowering participants to share and practice their own Freedom: privately and anonymously at wish.
  	
  The Underpinning of the new Cryptocurrency is an open source Blockchain software, based on proof of work mechanism that utilize CryptoNight algorithm Technology to provide secure platform across the multi Network Nodes and can achieve almost instantaneous and Anonymous transactions for all Participants efficiently by implementing Ring Signature Technology to obfuscate End signers from unwanted monitoring. 

  Privacy is a fundamental human right and our endeavour is to establish Dosh as a truly Decentralized Cryptocurrency and to implement Egalitarian proof of work voting system where every participant have equal voting rights on the Network.

  Our vision is to create: An Equitable Decentralized online Cryptocurrency featured with fast and secure means of direct payment for individuals who believe in Freedom, independence, Fairness and open Uncensored world.

   *Principles*


### Egalitarian Proof of work

Dosh is based on Egalitarian proof of work that acts as a voting system, Thus is Fairly distributed per vote without any special privileges and everyone is invited to join our network and start to mine and vote to secure all transactions on the Blockchain. No coin being premined , instamined or any additional imposed interest percentage on coin mining.


### Anonamyous Transactions

Most important aspect of our Objectives is to make All transactions on the Dosh Blockchain: anonymous and untraceable. CryptoNight scheme provides all participants with fully anonymous payment system through adopting Ring Signature Technology to render all payments executions indistinguishable and untraceable.


### Secure & Fast Confirmation
Dosh protocol is immune to hacks and the Data is protected through the implementation of CryptoNight Algorithm Technology which is impossible to crack. All transactions on the Blockchain are secured without the risk of loss of any Data and Transaction is fast and the conformation time of each Block is being mined averaged to 120 seconds (2 minutes). our road-map aims to minimize transaction time even to a few seconds with optimum security.

## Dosh Network

  The Transactions are modeled for PEER to PEER Global distributed network payment system to allow every individual freely send and receive Dosh cryptocurrency directly and settle all transactions without the need of a third party involvement or any other financial coordination. 

## Mining

  Anyone can mine Dosh using consumer CPU or GPU. Dosh Cryptcurrency mining is simple and based on CryptoNight Alogorithm Thus it's ASIC resistant and from your PC you can start Dosh mining straight away.  

## Open source

  Dosh CryptoCurrency is built on an Open source Software. This would permit everyone to participate in future network development. check our Github link and join our community. 

## What is cryptonote?
 
  CryptoNote is an application layer protocol that powers DOSH decentralized privacy oriented digital currency.
 Transactions executed by CryptoNote Algorithm cannot be followed through the blockchain in a way that reveals who sent or received the coins. The approximate amount of a transaction can be known, but the origin, destination, or actual amount cannot be learned. The only information available is that the actual amount was lower than the displayed amount. The only people with access to the whole set of data about a transaction are the sender or receiver of the transaction and the person who possesses one or both private keys.

  Two of the main features of CryptoNote are ring signatures that mask sender identities by mixing and one-time keys that make transactions unlinkable. Their combined effect gives a high degree of anonymity without any extra effort on the part of the user.

## Proof of work

  DOSH implement CryptoNote proof of work mechanism which is a voting system where users can vote for the right order of transactions, new features in the protocol and honest money supply distribution. It is important that during the voting process every participant have equal voting rights. CryptoNote coins use the CryptoNight algorithm to run DOSH blockchain and secure it's network. CryptoNight is a proof-of-work algorithm that mixes graphics processing unit (GPU) and central processing unit (CPU) mining to create a system resistant to both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and fast memory-on-chip devices. This is designed to create a more uniform distribution of coins through the currency's life.

## Blockchain analysis resistance

  The ability of tracing the money flow, identify the owners of the coins, determine wallet balances. The ability to make such analysis is due to the fact that all the transfers between addresses are transparent: every input in a transaction refers to a unique output. Moreover, users often re-use their old addresses, receiving and sending coins from them many times, which simplifies the analyst’s work. It happens unintentionally: if you have a public address (for example, for donations), you are sure to use this address in many inputs and transactions.

## Ring signature

  A ring signature is a type of digital signature that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members' keys was used to produce the signature.
